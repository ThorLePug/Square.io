*A game by ThorLePug*

This is my first real python game, made with the pygame library. It is quite small but does
include multiple features, such as a menu, a leaderboard and, of course, the game.

The game itself is quite simple : you are a cube trying to destroy other cubes to protect yourself.

**Controls**

- Arrows : Directions (no sideways movement)
- Space bar : Shield (protects you from incoming fire)
- Mouse movement and button : Aim and Shoot bullets (no reload)

Enjoy !!!
